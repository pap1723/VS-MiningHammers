# VS-MiningHammers
Vintage Story mod featuring some new tools to help with mining.

## FUTURE PLANS
* Fix breaking blocks UP and DOWN to allow for easier mining and tunnel creation
* Stone Core Sampler
  * This will work like the Prospecting Pick and will allow for looking at the rock density in the chunk you are in. Other tool modes might be available to let the player look directly below them.

## CHANGELOG

### Version v0.6.0
#### Major Changes
* SAVEBREAKING CHANGE: I had to change the name of the mod and the zip to be miningtools so any tools you had before will likely be removed from the game.
* NEW ITEMS: Clay molds for the Excavator Head and Mining Hammer Head
* NEW TOOL MODES
  * 1x1x1 - Breaks blocks like a normal Pickaxe
  * 1x2x1 - Single block width with 2 high block breaking
  * 2x2x1 - 2-block width and 2-block height block breaking
  * 3x3x1 - This is the default 3x3 block breaking
  * Checkerboard - Breaks blocks in a 3x3 area in a checkerboard "X" Pattern. Perfect setup for Raw Stone mining.
  * 1x3x3 - 1-block width and 3-block height and depth. Good companion for the Checkerboard to break the blocks behind the Raw Stone you are mining.

#### Known Issues
* This will likely remove any items, from the mod, that you had in a previous save.
* Using the tool to dig DOWN or UP will only break a single block. This will be fixed in a future update.
